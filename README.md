# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

There are a few means of optimizing a neural network:

Check out your input dataset: too many outliers in a single variable can lead to performance issues.


Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
Add additional hidden layers.
Use a different activation function for the hidden layers: The sigmoid function values are normalized to a probability between 0 and 1, which is ideal for binary classification.

Add additional epochs to the training regimen.


## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Bek's company AlphabetSoup is a philentropic organization that collects donations to help non-profit groups. Bek is tasked with predicting which groups are worth donating and which are high risk. This analysis involves a deep learning nueral network using Python's Tenserflow library. The code will evaluate all input data and produce a clear decision making result. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
  What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
  What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
